# Team Automaton - Reservation System NextBlock Hackathon
*(Sept 14th, 2018)*

We will try to implement a scalable permissioned hotel reservation system with a custom blockchain implementation.

We will use a tool we built called Automaton Core, which is written in C++ and provides scripting in Lua for the moment.

For this we will not store the history, rather validators will process transition states.

Please note, this is a quickly put together prototype and is definitely not production ready!

It's best to first start looking at the protocol message schema definition:

https://github.com/liberatix/reservationsystem/blob/master/reservationsystem.proto

Then look at the business logic in the .lua files.

More updates will be available on https://automaton.network
