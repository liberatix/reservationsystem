# Team Automaton - Reservation System NextBlock Hackathon (1 day, Sept 14th, 2018)

We will try to implement a scalable permissioned hotel reservation system with a custom blockchain implementation.

We will use a tool we built called Automaton Core, which is written in C++ and provides scripting in Lua for the moment.

For this we will not store the history, rather validators will process transition states.
